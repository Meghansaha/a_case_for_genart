  data-notes: "Good morning, everyone! Im Meghan Harris,a data scientist at the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium, and a generative artist that's here to introduce you all to generative art and,  potentially, a different approach to learning data science. But before I dive in to that, I have to tell you all that I feel like I'm only standing here right now because I decided to lock my work laptop in a drawer last year. Let me explain, I didn't go off the deep end, or _quiet quit_ or anything but 10 months ago, I gave birth to a beautiful baby and went on maternity leave for 6 months. I knew I didnt want to think about work during that time. But, because I love what I do, am passionate about coding, and am stubborn, I knew I would start missing it. So, as a compromise, I allowed myself to code on my personal computer, BUT, only if it was for fun stuff like art. Miraculously, even with the baby, I had a lot of opportunities to practice creating some art, and I was actually amazed at how much it helped me with my data science skills. I actually credit it for smoothing out my transition back into work. And today I'm going to show you all some examples of how."

<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

::: notes

With that being said, I also want to give a disclaimer that it's OK if you don't know how to make generative art, or even if you don't like art. It's also OK if you don't know much about data science. My  hope is that you treat this talk like a choose-your-own-adventure. just like those old goosebumps books. Hopefully, I'm not the only old person in here who remembers those, with those cool-looking covers? They kinda looked like this?

. . .

According to Wikipedia:

> *Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system.*

<br> <br>

. . .

Further:

> *An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist.*

::: notes
Webster doesn't have 'generative art' defined in their dictionary, so I had to go to Wikipedia.

Furthermore...I don't agree with the inclusion of the words "autonomous system."

It is true that some art is created with automated algorithms
