Im Meghan Harris, I'm a data scientist at the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium, and I'm also a generative artist that's here to introduce you all to generative art and, potentially, a different approach to learning data science. But before I dive in to that, I have to say that I feel like I'm only standing here because I decided to stop working about 10 months ago, as you can see here..."

I was very pregnant and ready to pop. I gave birth to a beautiful baby and went on maternity leave for 6 months and I know it sounds fake, but...

::: notes
... By the end of my leave, I was actually amazed at how much coding up art like this helped with practical data science skills. I actually credit stuff like this for smoothing out my transition back into work, and today, I want to give you all a glimpse of how that was possible.

<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

::: notes
With that being said, I also want to give a disclaimer that it's OK if you don't know how to make generative art, or even if you don't like art. It's also OK if you don't know much about data science. My hope is that you treat this talk like a choose-your-own-adventure. just like those old goosebumps books. Hopefully, I'm not the only old person in here who remembers those, with those cool-looking covers? They kinda looked like this?

## What is Generative Art? {.purple background-color="#6c4161"}

<br>

According to Wikipedia:

> *Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system.*

<br> <br>

. . .

Further:

> *An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist.*

::: notes
Webster doesn't have 'generative art' defined in their dictionary, so I had to go to Wikipedia.

Furthermore...I don't agree with the inclusion of the words "autonomous system."

It is true that some art is created with automated algorithms

In this room today, Generative Art is defined as:

<br>

> **Artwork created through a program in any language or interface. As long as a program executes the generation of the art, it can be considered generative art.**
