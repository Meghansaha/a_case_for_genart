For those of you interested in generative art, I hope this talk has convinced you to open up your favorite IDE and try it out. For those of you not interested, I encourage you all to consider integrating a hobby or interest into your learning journey if you're trying to improve any technical skills.

For those managing teams at work, could you make room in your team's scheduling to allow for personal development that looks like this? Are you willing to let go of the belief that learning only looks like online courses, textbooks, and boot camps? 

Regardless of what you do after this talk, think about how different perspectives and approaches may work for you. If you're having trouble understanding something, YouTube videos aren't cutting it, or blog posts are confusing you...Embrace learning in a low-stress environment fueled only by your interests. Let go of the notion that data science can only be for profit or practical insights. Remember that we can conquer these beautiful but abstract challenges by transforming them into passions that we love. And if you're struggling with that fact, that's OK. Just give it some time and remember that it's all about perspective.
